        {
          "startLine": 10,
          "startCharacter": 0,
          "endLine": 25,
          "endCharacter": 2,
          "name": "Authentication Module",
          "description": "User login, JWT tokens, OAuth integration"
        }
      ]
    },
    "src/db/repository.js": {
      "#4ECDC440": [
        {

      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This file can be:
